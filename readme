This is built (as of 9/9/2018) to read a single line of data from a text file.
To use this program, you have to get yourself a single text line of raw METAR data.
Copy this data from somewhere on the internet, preferably close to your location.
Airports are a safe bet, they have very complete data.
Paste it into a file called "weather.txt" and have that right next to the program.
Run the program, and read your station model to know what the current weather is.
REMEMBER! THIS DOES NOT FORECAST!
